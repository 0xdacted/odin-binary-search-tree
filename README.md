# odin-binary-search-tree
Creation of a binary search tree in Ruby.

This binary search tree project includes methods to create the tree (of nodes) recursively given an array of integers, methods to insert and delete new nodes, methods to find a node in the tree, its height, and its depth, methods to yield a block to each node in the tree by level order, preorder, postorder, or inorder, as well as methods to check whether the tree is balanced, and rebalance it if necessary.


This project is by far the most challenging one I have worked on up to this point, but I learned a ton and feel much more competent as a programmer!
